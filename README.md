### General Sprint Evidence Document (screenshots etc)
This doc has relevant evidence, screenshots, etc required for each sprint as part of the course assessments. This includes evidence of e.g., mob programming exercises, daily scrums, evidence of stakeholder presence and sprint reviews,

### Backlog/Kanban Board link
Backlog/Kanban Board link - <https://miro.com/app/board/uXjVNU4Q6oo=/?share_link_id=601517274408>

Note that the burndown chart can also be found on the above Miro board. Required screenshots for updates of the burndown chart can be found in the Evidence Doc, linked above.

### Rationale for ordering project backlog
We order the items in our product backlog first by the value we expect they will deliver to our stakeholders, and then by the order in which they need to be done. (e.g., if PBI A depends on PBI B to be done, then we list B first, then A, assuming they have the same value to our stakeholders.) 

### Definition of Ready
We consider a product backlog item ready when:
* It has a title
* The user story has at least an opening sentence
* Acceptance criteria have been enumerated
* The story has been estimated using story points
* Additional details are filled out as needed, possibly including:
    * Developer tasks
    * Plan of execution
 
### User Persona
As part of our development process, we performed an initial interview with stakeholder CM, and constructed a user persona from her input, which can be found [here]
(https://docs.google.com/document/d/1qXMOOKYEAWKNkg7sG3r7SIuSYhcEVEM7Kuf6qchsjVU/edit?usp=sharing).
 
### Other notes
To generate our initial backlog estimates, we used the estimation method "big uncertain small", as found here: 
<https://www.parabol.co/blog/agile-estimation-techniques/>
We then further refined our estimates and assigned story points by going through our backlog as a team in a manner similar to "magic estimation" (see same link above).

Only developers participate in our PBI estimates.

### Sprint 1 Notes

#### Story point estimation
For this sprint we forecast we'd finish 13 story points' worth of user stories. 

Since we have no prior information on expected or actual sprint velocity as a new team, this estimate came as a result of us talking as a team to determine individual capacities and skills for the sprint, and developers taking on cards they thought they could accomplish this sprint.

Only developers participated in sprint planning, estimating the number of story points in this sprint, and pulling appropriate stories from the product backlog to the sprint backlog for this sprint. 
### Testing
Tests for this and future sprints can be found in the top level `tests` directory inside the repo. This includes unit tests (in their own folder) and other tests (e.g. functional and integration) we use.

### Sprint 2 Notes 

#### Velocity Estimation
For this sprint, we used the "yesterday's weather" forecasting method to come up with an initial estimate of 8 story points this sprint, since that's the number of points we completed last sprint. We revised that to 9 since one of our developers in a fit of excitement accidentally implemented a 2-point feature not in last sprint's backlog, leaving just acceptance testing to be done.

Only developers participated in sprint planning, estimation, and pulling stories from the PB this sprint.
